# char_escape

A small and simple library for escaping & unescaping strings according to customizable rules.

## Overview

What does this crate do? It's probably best illustrated using an example:

```rust
use char_escape::Escaper;

// Define some standard escape sequences.
//
// Note that only chars can be used in rules.
// Also note that this is const.
const RULES: Escaper<'static> = char_escape::escaper! {
    escape_char = '\\',
    rules = [
        '\n' => 'n',
        '\t' => 't',
// A rule to escape the escape character is automatically generated by the macro
// (you can also opt out of this)
//      '\\' => '\\',
    ],
};

// Define some random string containing '\n'
let multiline = "\
one line
two lines";

// If escaped with the rules defined above, this will be the result
let escaped = "one line\\ntwo lines";

// Proof
assert_eq!(RULES.escape(multiline), escaped);

// "Unescaping" reverses what escape does
assert_eq!(RULES.unescape(escaped).expect("is properly escaped"), multiline);
```
